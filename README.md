As we discussed, we'll be happy if you can develop a quick prototype that will help us see you in action :)

## General idea
The idea is to have a short brief, of work, and an as-effective-as-possible result.
It'll help us estimate and understand your general problem-solving, technical, and product skills - all in quick&dirty mode of a mini-POC.


## The brief
We'd like to build a web app for browsing rockets launches from around the world. here is an example of an [app](https://go4liftoff.com/launches) that we want to create [launches app](https://go4liftoff.com/launches)


# The Requirements
Let's create a new web app project with one page that contains a search bar and a list of launches.
- List of all rocket launches in a past descending order starting today.
  * Entries of the list should display
    *  Name
    *  Status (success/failure)
    *  Mission description
    *  Image
    *  Copy to clipboard button
  * Share button will copy the URL to the clipboard similarly as [Go4Liftoff](https://go4liftoff.com/launches) do.
- Search - We'd like to allow the users to search after specific launches.
- Future launches - the user will be able to toggle this button and present future launches instead of passed launches.
- Bonus 1 - create pagination that will allow the user to jump forward and backward in time.
